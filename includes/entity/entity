<p><strong><code>Entities</code></strong> are objects that are <em>present</em> on the battlefield.<br>
There are a number of different types, each intended for different usages.<br></p>

<p>There are also different types to enable <em>custom scripts</em> to have additional behaviour.<br>
This additional behaviour is only available in their <em>source</em> scripts.<br>
Outside of their <em>source</em> scripts, any <strong><code>Entity</code></strong> object should be treated as if it didn&#39;t have custom scripting.<br><br></p>
