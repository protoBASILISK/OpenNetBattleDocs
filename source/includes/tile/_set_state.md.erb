### Tile : set_state()
``` lua
local tile 	-- example Tile
tile:set_state( TileState.Broken )
```

Attempts to set this **`Tile`** to a specific <%= @link_tile_state %>.<br>
If the **`Tile`** is `Hidden`, or one of the _invisible_ edge tiles around the battlefield, this will fail.<br>

Attempting to set this **`Tile`** to `Broken` will fail if this **`Tile`** has a <%= @link_character %> present on it _or_ reserving it.<br>
Successfully setting this **`Tile`** to `Broken` will cause it to start its _regeneration timer_.

Attempting to set this **`Tile`** to `Cracked` will fail if this **`Tile`** is currently `Broken` or `Empty`.

#### Function Call
`tile:set_state( TileState.Normal )`

#### Parameters
<%= @link_tile_state %> `tile_state`<br>
&emsp;_The <%= @link_tile_state %> you want to try to set this **`Tile`** to._
