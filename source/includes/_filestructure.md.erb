> An example of the file layout for user-generated content. It's recommended to follow a similar structure to this.

*All* user-generated content is located in the `OpenNetBattle/resources/mods/` directory.

The starting point of user-generated content (mods) are files called **`entry.lua`** (or **`mob.lua`** for encounters).<br>
Each set of mods *needs* at least one of these in order to be properly loaded by the engine.

## File Structure
### For a Playable Character

```
example_player
├─ entry.lua
├─ battle.animation
├─ battle.png
├─ mug.animation
├─ mug.png
├─ overworld.animation
├─ overworld.png
├─ phone.png
├─ preview.png
└─ ...
```
> An example of the file layout for a player mod.

#### entry.lua
This is the **main** file for the player mod. This is where *all* of the code goes.

#### .animation files
These are the files that control how the player character is drawn.

* `battle.animation` : How they're drawn *in battle*.
* `mug.animation` : How their face is drawn *while they're talking*.
* `overworld.animation` : How they're drawn *in the overworld*.

#### .png files

These are the files that contain the graphics for the player character.

* `battle.png` : The graphics for when they're *in battle*.
* `mug.animation` : The graphics for their face *while they're talking*.
* `overworld.animation` : The graphics for when they're *in the overworld*.
* `phone.png` : The graphics for the phone + icon in the top corner of the screen.
* `preview.png` : The graphics for when the player is selecting their character.
