**`Entities`** are objects that are *present* on the battlefield.<br>
There are a number of different types, each intended for different usages.<br>

There are also different types to enable *custom scripts* to have additional behaviour.<br>
This additional behaviour is only available in their *source* scripts.<br>
Outside of their *source* scripts, any **`Entity`** object should be treated as if it didn't have custom scripting.<br><br>

Entity Type | Scripted Type | Intended Usage
----------- | ------------- | --------------
<%= @link_character %>   | <%= @link_scripted_character %> | **Entities** with *AI scripting*.
`Player`      | `ScriptedPlayer`    | **Entities** *controllable* by a human player.
`Artifact`    | `ScriptedArtifact`  | Purely visual effects.
`Obstacle`    | `ScriptedObstacle`  | Mostly-static objects that can intercept attacks.
`Spell`       | `ScriptedSpell`     | Attacks and other effects that can influence **Entities**.
