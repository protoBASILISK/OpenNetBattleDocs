## Entity
**`Entities`** are objects that are *present* on the battlefield.<br>
There are a number of different types, each intended for different usages.<br>

There are also different types to enable *custom scripts* to have additional behaviour.<br>
This additional behaviour is only available in their *source* scripts.<br>
Outside of their *source* scripts, any **`Entity`** object should be treated as if it didn't have custom scripting.<br><br>

Entity Type | Scripted Type | Intended Usage
----------- | ------------- | --------------
<%= type 'Character' %> / <%= type 'ScriptedCharacter' %><br>
&emsp;<%= type 'Character' %> type objects are objects **with a health value**, some have *AI scripting*.

<%= type 'Player' %> / <%= type 'ScriptedPlayer' %><br>
&emsp;<%= type 'Player' %> type objects are <%= type 'Character' %>-type objects **controlled by a player**.

<%= type 'Obstacle' %> / <%= type 'ScriptedObstacle' %><br>
&emsp;<%= type 'Obstacle' %> type objects are <%= type 'Character' %>-type objects that are **spawned** by another <%= type 'Entity' %>.<br>
&emsp;They are mostly static objects.

<%= type 'Artifact' %><br>
&emsp;<%= type 'Artifact' %> type objects are **purely visual** objects. They **do not** interact with other **`Entity`** objects.

<%= type 'Spell' %>  / <%= type 'ScriptedSpell' %><br>
&emsp;<%= type 'Spell' %> type objects are **attacks and other effects** that can influence <%= type 'Entity' %> objects.
