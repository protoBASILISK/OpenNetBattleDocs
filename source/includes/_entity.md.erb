## Entity
**`Entities`** are objects that are *present* on the battlefield.<br>
There are a number of different types, each intended for different usages.<br>

There are also different types to enable *custom scripts* to have additional behaviour.<br>
This additional behaviour is only available in their *source* scripts.<br>
Outside of their *source* scripts, any **`Entity`** object should be treated as if it didn't have custom scripting.<br><br>

Entity Type | Scripted Type | Intended Usage
----------- | ------------- | --------------
<%= $link_list[:character] %> / <%= $link_list[:scripted_character] %><br>
&emsp;<%= $link_list[:character] %> type objects are objects **with a health value**, some have *AI scripting*.

<%= $link_list[:player] %> / <%= $link_list[:scripted_player] %><br>
&emsp;<%= $link_list[:player] %> type objects are <%= $link_list[:character] %>-type objects **controlled by a player**.

<%= $link_list[:obstacle] %> / <%= $link_list[:scripted_obstacle] %><br>
&emsp;<%= $link_list[:obstacle] %> type objects are <%= $link_list[:character] %>-type objects that are **spawned** by another <%= $link_list[:entity] %>.<br>
&emsp;They are mostly static objects.

<%= $link_list[:artifact] %><br>
&emsp;<%= $link_list[:artifact] %> type objects are **purely visual** objects. They **do not** interact with other **`Entity`** objects.

<%= $link_list[:spell] %>  / <%= $link_list[:scripted_spell] %><br>
&emsp;<%= $link_list[:spell] %> type objects are **attacks and other effects** that can influence <%= $link_list[:entity] %> objects.
