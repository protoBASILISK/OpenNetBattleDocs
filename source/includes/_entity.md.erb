## Entity
**`Entities`** are objects that are *present* on the battlefield.<br>
There are a number of different types, each intended for different usages.<br>

There are also different types to enable *custom scripts* to have additional behaviour.<br>
This additional behaviour is only available in their *source* scripts.<br>
Outside of their *source* scripts, any **`Entity`** object should be treated as if it didn't have custom scripting.<br><br>

Entity Type | Scripted Type | Intended Usage
----------- | ------------- | --------------
<%= @link_character %> / <%= @link_scripted_character %><br>
&emsp;<%= @link_character %> type objects are objects **with a health value**, some have *AI scripting*.

<%= @link_player %> / <%= @link_scripted_player %><br>
&emsp;<%= @link_player %> type objects are <%= @link_character %> type objects **controllable by a player**._

<%= @link_obstacle %> / <%= @link_scripted_obstacle %><br>
&emsp;<%= @link_obstacle %> type objects are <%= @link_character %> type objects that are **spawned** by another <%= @link_character %> type object.<br>
&emsp;They are mostly static objects.

<%= @link_artifact %> / <%= @link_scripted_artifact %><br>
&emsp;<%= @link_artifact %> type objects are **purely visual** objects. They **do not** interact with other **`Entity`** objects.

<%= @link_spell %>  / <%= @link_scripted_spell %><br>
&emsp;<%= @link_spell %> type objects are **attacks and other effects** that can influence **Entity** objects.
